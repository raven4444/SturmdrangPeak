The situation has grown worse in the castle. We have not heard anything in days. I fear for the lives of those trapped inside. We have managed to bargain for supplies with the thugs guarding the castle entrance and they have promised to release some of their hostages. It is Lady Vivianne I fear for. If the Commander finds out she is planning to escape, it will be the worse for her now I am sure. He has surely lost his mind to greed. This treasure he has found will be the ruin of us all. I only hope that salvation will arrive in the form of this Garrett fellow. Her letter said he was a skilled infiltrator."
