Business has been slow, but I'm doing well enough to stay afloat. If I could only find a way to sabotage that conniving son of a baboon Jak next door. Every time I legitimately locate a good fishing area, that stinking fat git comes along and cheats me out of it by fishing the area dry! I've a good mind to knock some manners into that thick head of his, perhaps with a good frozen-solid haddock."
