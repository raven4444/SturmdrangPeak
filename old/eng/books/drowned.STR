--Chapter 9 - The Final Days--

The goddess Mohana's rage was unparalleled. Winds howled and storms wracked the island nation. Rain flooded the streets and the very earth shook. The ground split and the sea leapt up to claw at the land. Only the Temple remained untouched. The High Priests knew that Mohana's anger would never be sated and with one last, desperate act, the Priests combined all their might and gave their lives to perform one last act of magic. They trapped the goddess within the flooded depths of her own temple and turned her corporeal form to stone, their own magic burning them to death in the process. Mohana's cries of rage became muted and futile, and the unquiet ocean did rest once more. But the damage was too great, and the city slipped beneath the waves and sank, its proud history lost forever to the reclaiming sea. Only the temple remained standing, forever guarding the horrifying secret within."
