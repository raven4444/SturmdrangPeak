You need to limit the flow by closing the gates at three intervals down each shaft. Too much or too little water flowing through the system won't trigger the mechanism. Once all four are correct the gate will open. The levers you have to pull are noted next to the main water levers. If one more person asks me about this, I'll ban the lot of you and you'll just have to go the long way through the mines."
