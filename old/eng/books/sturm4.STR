Captain William Sturmdrang

November 17th 1457

Centuries of bondage have made Mohana patient beyond my comprehension, yet she grows suspicious of my lack of progress. I don't know how many more years I can lie to her. If I break the seals now, she will surely discover and kill me for my deception. I must amass great treasure for her. Only that will appease her wrath I am sure. In the meantime I will seal up the temple and hide the sword. I must ensure that my crew aid me in amassing this offering without revealing the truth about my Queen, or mutinying in dismay against this course of action."
