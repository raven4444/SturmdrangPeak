           ___
No sooner had I finished the new ceremonial sword for the Commander than all this fighting starts in the castle. The Builder only knows what's going on up there. All I know is that unless it all gets sorted out soon, I'm not getting paid!

Luckily I still have that nugget I smelted from the ore Jamison sent. The fool has no idea of the value of his land. Maybe I should move to the City, open a jewellers with this startup capital so thoughtfully provided by my imbecilic supplier. 

With a bit of luck, I'll have some more supplies on tomorrow's boat, so at least I won't be twiddling my thumbs if the situation in the castle doesn't get resolved."
