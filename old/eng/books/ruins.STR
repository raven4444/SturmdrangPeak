There's a bit of loot for sure, but the way I hear it, there's a great big ruined temple on the other side of the island. Bound to be packed with ancient artefacts that is. Less risky too - if we hadn't had the element of surprise, they'd have overwhelmed us in no time. Oh well, not up to me. I just do what I'm told and try and stay alive, and I get paid."
