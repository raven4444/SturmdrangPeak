Search him thoroughly and put anything you find in the chest here. Stick that crystal sword in the chest too. I shouldn't think we'll need it any more now that the seal's broken, but I'd quite like to hang it above my fireplace when all this is over. Now that we've defeated Grent's scumbags, we'll be busy getting this treasure loaded onto the ship. When you're done searching him, dump him down the pipe to the cistern. Drowning in sewage should prove a fitting end for such a notorious criminal.
