Captain William Sturmdrang

July 19th 1442

Such wonders I have never seen. Deep into the abandoned temple we ventured, and found traces of long ago dark magic. The men would not continue, murmuring superstitious fears and running like trembling cowards. I continued alone and discovered more than I could ever have hoped. I have discovered Mohana herself. The Sea Queen speaks to me, even now in my head. She wishes me to discover a way to break the seal on her prison. We will build a fortress here on the island, which the men have named Sturmdrang Island in my honour. "
