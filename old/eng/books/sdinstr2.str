I have devised a system for the hiding and protection of my treasure vault. My men have worked tirelessly to build it into the very foundations of my castle. The mechanism is simple yet ingenious. One has only to pull the three switches hidden on the rooftops of the castle, and marvel at the fire conjured from the nearby braziers. Once all three fires are burning, the door in the library will slide open without trouble. The cleverness of the device comes from the timing. The magic flames shalt burn out in exactly eight minutes, causing the system to reset, and keeping the door sealed."
