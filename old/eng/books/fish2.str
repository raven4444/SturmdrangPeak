That scheming bastard Finn next door thinks he can outwit me! Always cheating me out of my rightful fishing and stealing all the best fish for himself before I even get out to the best fishing areas! Business is ok, but it would be much better if I could just be rid of that entrail-eating cur. Perhaps I could poison some fish-heads and jam them in his big stupid mouth!"
