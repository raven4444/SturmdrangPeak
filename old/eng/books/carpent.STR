Sailing with the buccaneers has been a most profitable venture thus far. Will Sturmdrang is a worthy captain, an honourable man, and keeps the men in line. Now we have come upon an isle worthy of constructing a more permanent base. The last vessel we captured was carrying a wealth of mining supplies, destined for the Silver Islands, and the men are hard at work expanding and enlarging the beehive of tunnels already naturally formed within the mountain. Meanwhile my duty lies at the southern side of the island, constructing a lighthouse that we might come around the isle from that side even despite it being a moonless night."
