page_0: "Commander,

Once again I respectfully request permission to excise certain books from the libraries here at Sturmdrang Castle. There are numerous old texts which are heretical in nature and deeply offensive to the Order of the Hammer, namely those cataloguing heathen religions and those relating to unholy magicks. Do not be fooled by Viridius, he will no doubt claim they have historical value or some such nonsense. There is nothing to be gained by studying these heresies save for the Builder's eternal displeasure.

Sincerely,
Brother Mason"
