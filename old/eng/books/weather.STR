page_0: "Dear Miriam,

I think I shall be returning to the City just as soon as I can get a job on one of the trading vessels passing through here. Life on this island is not the exciting adventure I had hoped. Instead it is a quiet and boring little town with nothing much to do besides hard work! And the weather is quite disagreeable to my sensibilities. It is always hot, even in the winter months, yet it rains a warm torrent most every day at various unpredictable times. One becomes soaked to the bone and drenched with sweat at the same time, a most unwelcome sensation.
Give my love to Pru and the twins.

Kind Regards,
Phillip"
