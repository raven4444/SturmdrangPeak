This job just keeps getting worse. I thought we were gonna just kill the commander and his men, and make off with his ship and the treasure. We could live like kings. But that ain't enough for Vivianne. She keeps banging on about some power over the sea and ancient magic. I thought it was an act but she actually believes in Mohana and all that rubbish. Hopefully she'll give it up when she finds nothing but ruins and old bones. She had us install a gate over the catacomb entrance, to stop intruders getting in. We're to guard the key here in this old tower. Dunno who the hell she's expecting - we took care of the commander and his men."
