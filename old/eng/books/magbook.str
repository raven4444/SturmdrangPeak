page_0: "Here follows an incantation for the binding of an object or being in temporally static crystal, the methods and limitations of such magicks and instruction in their reversal.

Know that the force of will required to successfully complete such a spell will vary greatly, dependent upon the subject of the casting. To summon the crystal necessary to seal a small object takes a learned mage very little energy at all. To bind a room or a living being requires significant practice and expenditure of energy. Larger creatures would require the combined concentration of multiple magi.

Also one should be aware of the limitations of such magick; that a crystalline sword (oft used as a focal point for the seal) may pierce crystal of like colour and nature with ease. The most advanced binding spells wouldst use multiple types of crystal to strengthen them."
