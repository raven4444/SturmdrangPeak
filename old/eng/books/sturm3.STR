Captain William Sturmdrang
                 ~~~
March 4th 1446

It has taken near four years, yet now I hold in my hand the first of the four crystal blades that seal my Goddess' prison.  The magics that held it were ancient and powerful. But I now understand their processes. The other seals would now be most simple to open, and yet I hesitate. Fear grips me. I know not what I might unleash should I free her. She strikes awe and base terror in me even frozen as she is in her eternal prison. Nay, I must wait, and think long on this. Work on the fortress nears completion. Soon we will take to the seas once more."
