Weed of Barathius

These small red-tipped plants grow mainly in warm, wet climates. They may be cultivated in a greenhouse by skilled gardeners. Named after Archmage Barathius who discovered them, the weed, when chewed, will act as a source of air, allowing the bearer to breathe underwater indefinitely."
