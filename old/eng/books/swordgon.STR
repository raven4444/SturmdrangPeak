I'm sure she knows what she's doing, but I'm glad she's not around here any more to snap at us for every mistake. She was annoyed about some crystal sword that could break these seals we've found about the place, apparently in all the confusion and double-crossing, it got left in the castle basement. Don't see how that's our fault though. We're just doing what we're told, hoping to get away with some treasure before they figure out what happened and hang the lot of us."
