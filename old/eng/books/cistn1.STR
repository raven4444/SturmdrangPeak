Lit up the place like a carnival. Different colour for each of the four shafts, so's Old Jacob don't gets lost. Musts I maintains the stairways, for they be slippery and wet. Old Jacob not be wanting to fall and break neck. Musts I return to the top and change the water flow, opens the locks, opens the gate. Only ways out for Old Jacob now. Hopes they's not forgot me down here working. I sees none of the crew for so long it seems."
