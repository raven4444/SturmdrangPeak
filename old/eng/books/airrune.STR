Vivianne's got us guarding one of these runestones that unlock the temple. Seems a little overcautious to me, seeing as we already locked it and reset all the ancient traps, but far be it from me to question Vivianne. She knows what she's doing - she's such a smart, and dare I say beautiful, woman. Boy I'd like to get some alone time with her. Maybe if I do a good job guarding the stone, and keeping the others in line, she'll be so grateful she'll reward me with a bit of rough and tumble. Cor, that'd be good."
