There's been another cave-in near the underground river. By the fortune of Mohana, no-one got hurt but if you want us to keep digging, it'll be weeks before we can get back down to the main shaft. If you ask me, we got most of them glowing crystals anyway, and it ain't worth the extra effort. Let us know how you want to proceed."
