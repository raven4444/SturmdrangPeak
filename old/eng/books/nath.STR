This is the unusual name given to a point on the south-east end of Sturmdrang Island. As the story goes, Nathaniel was a loyal member of Sturmdrang's crew, until he murdered a fellow crewman for an extra share of the treasure. Sturmdrang's response was swift justice - the fellow was stripped and nailed upright to the lighthouse wall above the cliffs. His howls of anguish lasted throughout the night, warning the rest of the crew of the price of disloyalty, until he succumbed to blood loss at first light."
