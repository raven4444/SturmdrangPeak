When can you visit the city again? My heart yearns for you. It is so cold and lonely without you. I would so dearly wish to come away with you to your wonderful little island. It sounds so exciting and beautiful. Alas, my contract holds me here for another year my darling. That is... unless I were to be married. That would invalidate my contract and we could be together forever! I eagerly await your reply.

    Your beloved,
                  Jessica"
