These mechanical contraptions were not built for the humid weather and unpredictable rainstorms down here. The Hammers think they're so great, but the tropical conditions play havoc with the electrics. I think I've fixed up the generator so the streetlights won't go out again, but I'll be buggered if I'm coming back to fix it again today. I'm off to see Wendy down the docks, get plastered and try to slip my hand up her skirt."
