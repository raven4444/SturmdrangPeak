Work on the secret entrance is complete. It'll be a damp, unpleasant trip through the sewers should we ever have to use it, but it should prove a useful bolt hole should the Navy come visiting our little island. I've sent Bjorn and Lemba the way of all flesh as you instructed. Now since I'm quite sure you're planning on killing me as well to keep this little secret, I've taken the liberty of deserting. Don't come looking for me.

Steffan"
