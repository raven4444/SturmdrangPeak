This is the last declaration of Captain William Sturmdrang. You bastards can return to your ships. No mortal shall ever touch my treasure. It is my offering to Mohana, goddess of the tides, and no greater servant has she than my loyal self. I go now to the distant shore, for my life is spent. May the great goddess watch over my passage and guide me safely to the next life. Mohana, I have secured thy treasure with a crystal seal that only I know the secret of opening. I am close to death now, so the seal shall outlast the sun."
