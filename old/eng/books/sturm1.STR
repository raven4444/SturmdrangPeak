Captain William Sturmdrang

July 16th 1442

We have arrived at one of the many uncharted islands that dot the Southern Passage. Repairs to the hull and masts should be under-way as I write this. I think these merchant vessels become more heavily armed by the day. Some of the men have reported that the island is riddled with caves and the ruins of an old temple. It occurs to me that this island may make a good base of operations in these waters. I shall take some of the men and explore the island in its entirety."
