Grent's got me and Roth on guard duty down here where we're more likely to get killed by the damn Watch in the village. His money's good, but he's just one of them people you want to smack. Got one of them faces.

I swear, one of these days, he'll take his holier-than-
thou attitude and start raggin on about what an expert treasure hunter he is, and I'll just lose it and jam my sword right into his pasty little face. 

We gots a delivery of supplies and food and stuff this morning. Managed to bargain a trade for a couple of hostages. They'd better break through soon and capture some more. The only one we got left is that fool who tried being a hero and got hisself stabbed up. He ain't gonna last much longer I'll wager."
