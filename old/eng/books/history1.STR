Sturmdrang Peak, a small island in a strategically valuable location in the Southern Ocean, is known as the headquarters of our great Navy. But it wasn't always this way. The mountainous isle was originally uninhabited by all except the natives of the Southern Islands. They built a great temple to the pagan deity Mohana in the shadow of the mountain, and men from many different tribes would make a pilgrimage to the temple as part of their coming-of-age rituals. Aside from the caretakers of the temple, the island remained uninhabited and eventually the temple fell into ruin as the various tribes came into contact with Hammerite missionaries and abandoned their heathen ways. The island was then completely uninhabited for a number of decades, until piracy increased significantly around the beginning of the last century. "
